# Wanix Documentation

Welcome to the Wanix documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about the Wanix virtual environment toolchain, its architecture, and development practices.

## What is Wanix?

Wanix is a capability-oriented microkernel that brings Plan 9's "everything is a file" philosophy to the web. It allows you to build virtual environments that run in browsers and natively, supporting both WebAssembly (WASI) and x86 executables.

## üöÄ [Quick Reference](./quick-reference.md)

## Quick Start

1. **Install Wanix**: See [Building Wanix](./development/building.md)
2. **Understand the basics**: Read [Core Concepts](./architecture/core-concepts.md)
3. **Try it online**: Visit [wanix.run](https://wanix.run)

## Key Concepts Summary

- **Everything is a File**: All system resources are exposed through the filesystem
- **Per-Process Namespaces**: Each process has its own view of the filesystem
- **Capabilities through File Services**: Access to resources is controlled by what's in your namespace
- **Multi-Runtime Support**: Run both WASI WebAssembly and x86 Linux executables
