Based on my analysis of the `2115-analysis.md` file, the core issue blocking the Node.js MVP is a path resolution bug within the VFS layer. Specifically, when `fs.Resolve` is called, it incorrectly strips path prefixes during recursive lookups, leading to "file not found" errors during the shell's initialization process.

The following instructions will guide the coding agent to definitively solve this by replacing the complex and buggy path resolution logic in `vfs.NS.ResolveFS` with a simpler, more correct implementation. This new implementation correctly identifies the responsible filesystem for a given path and returns the correct relative path within that filesystem, preventing the path stripping issue.

### **Instructions for the Coding Agent**

Your task is to fix the VFS path resolution logic in `vfs/vfs.go`. The current implementation incorrectly handles path resolution across nested, bound filesystems, leading to errors during shell initialization.

You will replace the existing complex logic in `vfs/vfs.go` with a streamlined and corrected implementation of the `ResolveFS` method for the `*vfs.NS` type.

**File to Modify:** `vfs/vfs.go`

**Instructions:**

1.  Locate the `ResolveFS` function for the `*NS` struct in `vfs/vfs.go`.
2.  Delete the entire body of the function.
3.  Replace it with the following new implementation. This change simplifies the logic by correctly identifying the most specific filesystem for a given path and calculating the new relative path without losing context.

```go
// In vfs/vfs.go

func (ns *NS) ResolveFS(ctx context.Context, name string) (fs.FS, string, error) {
	// Handle direct bindings first.
	// If a path is explicitly bound, it's the most specific match.
	if refs, ok := ns.bindings[name]; ok {
		if len(refs) == 1 {
			// A single, non-union binding. Return it directly.
			return refs[0].fs, refs[0].path, nil
		}
		// A union binding. The namespace itself must handle it.
		return ns, name, nil
	}

	// Find all potential parent bindings for the given path.
	var bindPaths []string
	for p := range ns.bindings {
		bindPaths = append(bindPaths, p)
	}

	// Find the longest matching parent binding path.
	// fskit.MatchPaths sorts by longest path first.
	for _, bindPath := range fskit.MatchPaths(bindPaths, name) {
		// We only resolve into the first filesystem of a union.
		// Writable filesystems should be bound first ("after" mode).
		if refs, ok := ns.bindings[bindPath]; ok && len(refs) > 0 {
			ref := refs[0]

			// Calculate the new path relative to the bound filesystem's root.
			subPath := strings.Trim(strings.TrimPrefix(name, bindPath), "/")
			newPath := path.Join(ref.path, subPath)

			// Return the bound filesystem and the correctly calculated relative path.
			return ref.fs, newPath, nil
		}
	}

	// If no binding matched, the path must be resolved from the root of the namespace itself.
	return ns, name, nil
}
```

This single, targeted change corrects the fundamental flaw in the path resolution logic. After applying this patch and rebuilding, the shell initialization errors should be resolved, allowing the Node.js MVP tests to proceed.
